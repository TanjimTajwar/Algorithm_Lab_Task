Regular Falsi Method

Definition:
The Regular Falsi Method is a numerical method used to find the root of an equation. It is an iterative method and an improved version of the Bolzano method.

Equation:
xᵣ = x₁ - f(x₁)(x₂-x₁)/(f(x₂)-f(x₁))

Where:
- xᵣ is the new estimated root
- x₁ and x₂ are two initial points
- f(x) is the original equation

Solution Method:
1. First, choose two points x₁ and x₂ where f(x₁) and f(x₂) have opposite signs
2. Use the above equation to find xᵣ
3. Calculate f(xᵣ)
4. If f(xᵣ) = 0, then xᵣ is the root
5. If f(xᵣ) ≠ 0, then:
   - If f(xᵣ) and f(x₁) have the same sign, then x₁ = xᵣ
   - If f(xᵣ) and f(x₂) have the same sign, then x₂ = xᵣ
6. Repeat from step 2 until the desired accuracy is achieved
