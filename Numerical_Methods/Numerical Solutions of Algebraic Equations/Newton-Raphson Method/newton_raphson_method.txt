Newton-Raphson Method

Definition:
The Newton-Raphson Method is an iterative numerical method used to find the root of an equation. This method is based on the concept of tangent lines.

Formula:
x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n)

Where:
- x_n is the current approximation
- x_{n+1} is the next approximation
- f(x) is the original function
- f'(x) is the first derivative of the function

Steps of the Method:
1. Take an initial guess x₀
2. Calculate f(x₀) and f'(x₀)
3. Use the formula to find x₁
4. Repeat the process until desired accuracy is achieved

Problem 1:
Find the root of the equation f(x) = x² - 4 = 0. Initial guess x₀ = 2.5

Problem 2:
Find the root of the equation f(x) = x³ - 2x - 5 = 0. Initial guess x₀ = 2

Problem 3:
Find the root of the equation f(x) = cos(x) - x = 0. Initial guess x₀ = 0.5

Problem 4:
Find a root of the equation f(x) = x⁴ - 3x² + 2 = 0. Initial guess x₀ = 1.5

Problem 5:
Find the root of the equation f(x) = e^x - 3x = 0. Initial guess x₀ = 1

Problem 6:
Find the root of the equation f(x) = ln(x) - 2 = 0. Initial guess x₀ = 7

Problem 7:
Find the root of the equation f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 10 = 0. Initial guess x₀ = 1.5

Problem 8:
Find the root of the equation f(x) = sin(x) - x/2 = 0. Initial guess x₀ = 1

Problem 9:
Find the root of the equation f(x) = x⁵ - 3x + 1 = 0. Initial guess x₀ = 1

Problem 10:
Find the root of the equation f(x) = tan(x) - x = 0. Initial guess x₀ = 4.5

Solution Guidelines:
1. For each problem, determine f(x) and f'(x)
2. Use the Newton-Raphson formula to iterate
3. Update the value of x at each step
4. Continue the process until desired accuracy (e.g., 0.0001) is achieved

Note: Perform at least 4 iterations for each problem and write down the value at each step.
