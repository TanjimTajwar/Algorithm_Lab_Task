Simpson's 1/3 Rule Programming Problems
=====================================

1. Write a program to calculate the definite integral of f(x) = x^2 from 0 to 1 using Simpson's 1/3 rule with n = 4 intervals. Compare the result with the exact value.

2. Implement Simpson's 1/3 rule to find the area under the curve f(x) = sin(x) from 0 to π. Use n = 6 intervals and compare with the exact value.

3. Create a program that uses Simpson's 1/3 rule to calculate the integral of f(x) = e^x from 0 to 1. Allow the user to input the number of intervals and show how the accuracy changes with different values of n.

4. Write a program to find the volume of a sphere using Simpson's 1/3 rule by integrating the function f(x) = π(1-x^2) from -1 to 1. Use n = 8 intervals.

5. Implement Simpson's 1/3 rule to calculate the work done by a force F(x) = 2x + 3 from x = 0 to x = 5. Use n = 10 intervals.

6. Create a program that uses Simpson's 1/3 rule to find the center of mass of a rod with linear density ρ(x) = 1 + x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2. Use n = 6 intervals.

7. Write a program to calculate the arc length of the curve y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 1 using Simpson's 1/3 rule. The formula for arc length is ∫√(1 + (dy/dx)^2)dx. Use n = 8 intervals.

8. Implement Simpson's 1/3 rule to find the average value of the function f(x) = cos(x) over the interval [0, π/2]. Use n = 4 intervals.
